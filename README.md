# Event Tracker Front End

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/robertvessnalong/eventtracker-frontend)

This is a front-end application created using Create-React-App, React-Bootstrap, and Axios. All API calls are being handled by [api.js](src/API/api.js).

If you would like to add your own backend, you can replace BASE_URL and modify each route:

```
const BASE_URL = 'https://eventtracker-backend.herokuapp.com';
```

- API Calls are being directed to the [Backend](https://github.com/robertvessnalong/eventtracker-backend)

Components data for Events, Performers, and Venues are all being fetched from the SeatGeek API. These components allow for querying, so a user can search for a specific Event, Performer, and Venue.
